# lesson3-how-to-succeed
How do I succeed in this class?

You will succeed by working hard, communicating, asking questions, exploring, and staying organized.

## Work Hard:
Most of your productive work will be done outside of this class. That means that you have to be able to organize team meetings, team work sessions, and work on your own! As you get into it, you will really enjoy it and learn a ton! I promise! But first you have to get past the annoying hard-work-hump and get to the fun stuff! The more work you put in at the beginning the sooner you will feel comfortable with the technologies, and the sooner you will start having fun.

You may not know it now, but this is class that will get you your internships, your return offers, and your signing bonuses. The things you learn in other classes are the bare minimum of what it takes to get an interview. The things you learn in this class are things that will make you stand out from the other interns and new hires and make you a worthwhile hire for your company.

## Symmetry:
Tough you should work hard, it is important to that you don't get too far ahead of your teammates. The further ahead you get, and the more code you add, the harder it will be for your teammates to catch up. The further behind they get, the more they will lose motivation to even try and catch up. If your teammates are getting behind because they are lazy that is one thing, but if you are choosing to put in 60 hours a week on your project, and are wondering why your teammates have no idea what is going on, I will not be too sympathetic. Work hard and encourage your teammates to work hard. If you forsee a significant difference in effort talk to me and try to divide your project up into independent parts.

## Communication:
Class time is for planning and communicating, and working through persistent issues. There are also other kinds of communication though. For development related communication we will be using 'Github issues'. These are used to assign tasks, track bugs, and keep track of which code goes with what functionality. We will cover the practical examples in class.

## Ask questions:
Always try to find the answer to questions yourself first, but know when to give up. I won't know the answer to everything, but we will have multiple hours of class time a week where I will be able to help.

## Explore:
While trying to find answers to your own problems you will find many interesting facts along the way. Even if you never find the solution to your problem you will likely find answers to questions you have not yet encountered. The more of these answers you stumble upon, the greater chance that you will be able to solve future problems and really gain an understanding of the platforms we are using.

## Stay Organized:
Use in person communication and github issues to make sure that everyone has concrete tasks at all times. You should always know what you and your teammates are working on, should have a goal of when it will be finished and minimize overlap between tasks. Along these same lines, it is vital that you always pull the most recent version of cloud code, and always push your most recent progress, so that others have your code. Your code doesn't have to work to be pushed, just make sure it doesn't break other peoples things.

## Get to know your teammates:
Understand the skill levels and interests of your teammates from the beginning. Try and work on tasks that you are interested in, and leverage the skills of other people on your team. If someone on your team is extra quiet, take extra care to ask their opinions on things. Just because they are quiet does not mean that they don't have an opinion or expertise on the subject that the rest of the team is discussing.

## Frontload your work:
Keep in mind that as the semster progresses, your other classes will only become more demanding (except 381, that becomes easier)! Use this free time at the beginning of the semester to get a head start. If you can finish 3/4 of the work in the first half of the semester I am more than happy to let you slack a bit for the second half of the semester. It is important that the work gets done; Don't worry about checking in 'x' lines of code per week.

## Take this class for multiple semesters!
Depending on the amount of time you have to commit to the class there is a good chance that you may not fully understand what you are doing until the end of the class. I can guaruntee you that regardless of your level of mastery, you will be twice as productive the second semester and get more out of it. In one semester you can get something working, but in two you can truly create a masterpiece, and master the technologies you are working with.
